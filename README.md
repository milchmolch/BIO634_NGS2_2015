## Recommended books

- [Haddock & Dunn. Practical Computing for Biologists. Sinauer Associates 2011.](http://practicalcomputing.org))
  A good book that covers the shell/command line, programming in python & bash, databases, regular expressions. 
  Suitable for self-study and as a reference book.

- [Vince Buffalo. Bioinformatics Data Skills. O'reilly 2015](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do)
  This practical book teaches the skills that scientists need for turning large sequencing datasets into reproducible and robust biological findings.
  Also covers methods on Sequence and Alignment Data. 
  More advanced than Haddock & Dunn and progresses with faster pace.
